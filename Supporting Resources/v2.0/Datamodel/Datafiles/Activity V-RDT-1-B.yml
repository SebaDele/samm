  Detect security bugs that would have often been missed by human eyes.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Perform security fuzzing testing

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  During security tests, cover at least a minimum fuzzing for vulnerabilities against the main input parameters of the application.

  Perform fuzzing, sending massive amounts of random data, to the test subject in an attempt to make it crash. Fuzz testing or Fuzzing is a Black Box software testing technique, which consists of finding implementation bugs using automated malformed or semi-malformed data injection.

  The great advantage of fuzz testing is that the test design is extremely simple, and free of preconceptions about system behavior. The random approach allows this method to find bugs that human eyes would often miss. Plus, when the tested system is totally closed (say, a SIP phone), fuzzing is one of the only means of reviewing its quality.

  Consider the use of automated fuzzing tools and build an application specific dictionary of fuzzing payloads like fault injection patterns, predictable resource locations, and regexes for matching server responses (you can start with open source dictionaries like FuzzDB*)
