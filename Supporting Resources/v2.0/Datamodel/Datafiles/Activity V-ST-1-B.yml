#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Detect vulnerabilities that cannot by found with tools.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Perform manual security testing of high-risk components

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Perform selective blackbox manual security testing, usually using a combination of open source automated utilities (static and dynamic) for performing hands-on analysis to attempt to further ‘hack’ the application as an attacker.

  Code-level vulnerabilities in security-critical parts of software can have dramatically increased impact so project teams review high-risk modules for common vulnerabilities. Common examples of high-risk functionality include authentication modules, access control enforcement points, session management schemes, external interfaces, and input validators and data parsers.

  During development cycles where high-risk code is changed and reviewed, development managers triage the findings and prioritize remediation appropriately with input from other project stakeholders.
